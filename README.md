"T' Ligjt Do Shfarosen" is the second song from the album 'Ti e Do Drejtësinë'.
 
In the introduction of the song, I enter with integrity and justice for protection.

Then I turn to the hostility that supports me because of my integrity because I hope.

I continue in verses with the hope of becoming and following the steadfast paths, to be exalted, and to inherit righteousness.
Then I turn to the listeners to see the retribution of the wicked.

I slowly refer to God because it is the hope that fills us with joy and peace, through faith, that we may abound in hope with the power of courage like eagles!

The Elder loves justice. We cannot fully discover the Almighty. He does not despise righteous judgment the righteousness that abounds.

I continue to show the righteousness of righteous deeds. Only the righteous see the right and the justice being confessed fully of songs.

But he that is held the greatest let him be held the greatest, for he has deep criticism and knowledge, I place myself, Deny D, to show kindness, for wonderful deeds and wipe out transgressions with my songs. Because I enjoy these things, like the Elder without abandoning his faithful ones.


The verse continues to guard the faithful, for the wicked will remain silent in the dark, for the superiority of the noble does not depend on power.


To him who is faithful deal faithfully, treat the mighty and blameless man as he deserves. He will oversee the paths of judgment and guard the path of his faithful.
                     
Then I turn to always stand protected to those who want to become, and hate evil, to preserve the souls of the faithful, to deliver them in times of suffering, and the wicked will be destroyed.


Even if they increase, they will go to the edge of the sword.

They will not be satisfied with bread. Their name is blotted out, until the next generation.
          
At the end of the verse it is addressed to the wicked that they will be exterminated and the unfaithful will be removed from power.
